Notes
This script is based on an original implementation by - [@Python-World](https://github.com/Python-World)
.
I have made some alterations to the script for personal use.
The script uses the socket module in Python to perform port scanning.
It scans ports from 1 to 65534 by default.
The progress of the scan is displayed using a loading bar in the terminal.
